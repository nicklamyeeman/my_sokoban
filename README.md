<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a school project of the Epitech school. The goal is to recreate the famous Japanese game of the same name: Sokoban.
The player "P" has to move all the boxes "X" on the "O" locations. Once all the "O" places are replaced by the "X" places, the level is finished and validated.
11 levels are available !

### Built With

* [Ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html)

Each original level is harder than the previous one.
You can use <kbd>Space</kbd> to restart the level your currently trying to solve
